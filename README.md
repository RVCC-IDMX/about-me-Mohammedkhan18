Hi there, my name is **Mohammed Khan** and this is my About Me Website [![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/ce964819-fdaa-4e37-b28d-d6e8ddb764ce/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/about-me-mohammed-khan/deploys)



## Project Description:
The purpose of this project was to implement  the concepts that we learned in class to our own website. These concepts can include:

* We used HTML as the backbone of the webpage. We added things like objects, images, navbars, video, etc. 

* Styled the website using CSS

* Found and debugged code to tweak the webpage

* Learned how to identify and label accessibility issues

* Learned about Good Design Principles

* Learned how to make a website responsive

While doing this project, I learned many skills which you can read right below:

#### Navbar Section

While working on the navbar section, I learned how to create a practical and  active navbar in which my user will be able to instantly get to any section on the webpage. Additionally, I learned how to build a "hamburger menu" for mobile screen sizes and to make the background of the links transparent. 

#### Profile Section

When I was working on the profile section, I learned how to insert an avatar/image. Additionally, I created a small div for my basic info like my name and where I am from. 

#### Bio Section 

While I was working on the bio section, I refined the skills I learned from the profile section. I also learned how to add a background image using only css. I made the bio section transparent, so the image could be seen. 

#### Hobbies Section 

While I was working on the hobbies section, I learned how to create an unordered list. 

#### Gallery Section

While I was working on the gallery section, I learned how to add images and how to use a figure to provide captions to my images. I was able to change how the multiple figures looked on the webpage. For example, while the screen size is a laptop or a desktop, the 3 figures will be in a row with the captions on the bottom. For the iPhone size, the 3 figures will be in a column with the captions on the bottom. I also learned how to add hover effects to the images. 

#### Lit Section 




#### Video Section

When I was working on the video section, I learned how to create iframes and all of the different properties I could use in my webpage. I was able to stretch my knowledge of css to create a responsive iframe.

## Color Scheme:
When using CSS to make my webpage, I had to come up with a color scheme that looks good and is easily readable (minimum color contrast of 4.5). The color scheme is below:

* #0E219E or rgb(14,33,158,) <img width="20" height="20" alt="color1" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/112670851/206604933-a5a70172-18a4-4482-ac12-d4382c424a19.png">
